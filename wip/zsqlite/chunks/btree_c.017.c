** A CellArray object contains a cache of pointers and sizes for a
** consecutive sequence of cells that might be held on multiple pages.
**
** The cells in this array are the divider cell or cells from the pParent
** page plus up to three child pages.  There are a total of nCell cells.
**
** pRef is a pointer to one of the pages that contributes cells.  This is
** used to access information such as MemPage.intKey and MemPage.pBt->pageSize
** which should be common to all pages that contribute cells to this array.
**
** apCell[] and szCell[] hold, respectively, pointers to the start of each
** cell and the size of each cell.  Some of the apCell[] pointers might refer
** to overflow cells.  In other words, some apCel[] pointers might not point
** to content area of the pages.
**
** A szCell[] of zero means the size of that cell has not yet been computed.
**
** The cells come from as many as four different pages:
**
**             -----------
**             | Parent  |
**             -----------
**            /     |     \
**           /      |      \
**  ---------   ---------   ---------
**  |Child-1|   |Child-2|   |Child-3|
**  ---------   ---------   ---------
**
** The order of cells is in the array is for an index btree is:
**
**       1.  All cells from Child-1 in order
**       2.  The first divider cell from Parent
**       3.  All cells from Child-2 in order
**       4.  The second divider cell from Parent
**       5.  All cells from Child-3 in order
**
** For a table-btree (with rowids) the items 2 and 4 are empty because
** content exists only in leaves and there are no divider cells.
**
** For an index btree, the apEnd[] array holds pointer to the end of page
** for Child-1, the Parent, Child-2, the Parent (again), and Child-3,
** respectively. The ixNx[] array holds the number of cells contained in
** each of these 5 stages, and all stages to the left.  Hence:
**
**    ixNx[0] = Number of cells in Child-1.
**    ixNx[1] = Number of cells in Child-1 plus 1 for first divider.
**    ixNx[2] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2 + 1 for 1st divider.
**    ixNx[3] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2 + both divider cells
**    ixNx[4] = Total number of cells.
**
** For a table-btree, the concept is similar, except only apEnd[0]..apEnd[2]
** are used and they point to the leaf pages only, and the ixNx value are:
**
**    ixNx[0] = Number of cells in Child-1.
**    ixNx[1] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2.
**    ixNx[2] = Total number of cells.
**
** Sometimes when deleting, a child page can have zero cells.  In those
** cases, ixNx[] entries with higher indexes, and the corresponding apEnd[]
** entries, shift down.  The end result is that each ixNx[] entry should
** be larger than the previous
