  /* The following describes the implementation of the various locks and

  ** confusion with SQLite lock names). The algorithms are complicated
  ** slightly in order to be compatible with Windows95 systems simultaneously
  ** accessing the same database file, in case that is ever required.
  **
  ** Symbols defined in os.h identify the 'pending byte' and the 'reserved
  ** byte', each single bytes at well known offsets, and the 'shared byte
  ** range', a range of 510 bytes at a well known offset.
  **
  ** To obtain a SHARED lock, a read-lock is obtained on the 'pending
  ** byte'.  If this is successful, 'shared byte range' is read-locked
  ** and the lock on the 'pending byte' released.  (Legacy note:  When
  ** SQLite was first developed, Windows95 systems were still very common,
  ** and Windows95 lacks a shared-lock capability.  So on Windows95, a
  ** single randomly selected by from the 'shared byte range' is locked.
  ** Windows95 is now pretty much extinct, but this work-around for the
  ** lack of shared-locks on Windows95 lives on, for backwards
  ** compatibility.)
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a RESERVED lock after it has a SHARED lock.
  ** A RESERVED lock is implemented by grabbing a write-lock on the
  ** 'reserved byte'.
  **
  ** An EXCLUSIVE lock may only be requested after either a SHARED or
  ** RESERVED lock is held. An EXCLUSIVE lock is implemented by obtaining
  ** a write-lock on the entire 'shared byte range'. Since all other locks
  ** require a read-lock on one of the bytes within this range, this ensures
  ** that no other locks are held on the database.
  **
  ** If a process that holds a RESERVED lock requests an EXCLUSIVE, then
  ** a PENDING lock is obtained first. A PENDING lock is implemented by
  ** obtaining a write-lock on the 'pending byte'. This ensures that no new
  ** SHARED locks can be obtained, but existing SHARED locks are allowed to
  ** persist. If the call to this function fails to obtain the EXCLUSIVE
  ** lock in this case, it holds the PENDING lock instead. The client may
  ** then re-attempt the EXCLUSIVE lock later on, after existing SHARED
  ** locks have cleared.
