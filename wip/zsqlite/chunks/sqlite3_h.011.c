** API call.
** ^The sqlite3_extended_errcode()
** interface is the same except that it always returns the
** [extended result code] even when extended result codes are
** disabled.
**
** The values returned by sqlite3_errcode() and/or
** sqlite3_extended_errcode() might change with each API call.
** Except, there are some interfaces that are guaranteed to never
** change the value of the error code.  The error-code preserving
** interfaces include the following:
**
** <ul>
** <li> sqlite3_errcode()
** <li> sqlite3_extended_errcode()
** <li> sqlite3_errmsg()
** <li> sqlite3_errmsg16()
** <li> sqlite3_error_offset()
** </ul>
**
** ^The sqlite3_errmsg() and sqlite3_errmsg16() return English-language
** text that describes the error, as either UTF-8 or UTF-16 respectively,
** or NULL if no error message is available.
** (See how SQLite handles [invalid UTF] for exceptions to this rule.)
** ^(Memory to hold the error message string is managed internally.
** The application does not need to worry about freeing the result.
** However, the error string might be overwritten or deallocated by
** subsequent calls to other SQLite interface functions.)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_errstr(E) interface returns the English-language text
** that describes the [result code] E, as UTF-8, or NULL if E is not an
** result code for which a text error message is available.
** ^(Memory to hold the error message string is managed internally
** and must not be freed by the application)^.
**
** ^If the most recent error references a specific token in the input
** SQL, the sqlite3_error_offset() interface returns the byte offset
** of the start of that token.  ^The byte offset returned by
** sqlite3_error_offset() assumes that the input SQL is UTF8.
** ^If the most recent error does not reference a specific token in the input
** SQL, then the sqlite3_error_offset() function returns -1.
**
** When the serialized [threading mode] is in use, it might be the
** case that a second error occurs on a separate thread in between
** the time of the first error and the call to these interfaces.
** When that happens, the second error will be reported since these
** interfaces always report the most recent result.  To avoid
** this, each thread can obtain exclusive use of the [database connection] D
** by invoking [sqlite3_mutex_enter]([sqlite3_db_mutex](D)) before beginning
** to use D and invoking [sqlite3_mutex_leave]([sqlite3_db_mutex](D)) after
** all calls to the interfaces listed here are completed.
**
** If an interface fails with SQLITE_MISUSE, that means the interface
** was invoked incorrectly by the application.  In that case, the
** error code and message may or may not be set.

** (The "_LIMIT_" in the name is changed to "_MAX_".))^
** ^Attempts to increase a limit above its hard upper bound are

/*
** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
** METHOD: sqlite3
** CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3_stmt
**
** To execute an SQL statement, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.  Or, in other words, these routines
** are constructors for the [prepared statement] object.
**
** The preferred routine to use is [sqlite3_prepare_v2()].  The
** [sqlite3_prepare()] interface is legacy and should be avoided.
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()] has an extra "prepFlags" option that is used
** for special purposes.
**
** The use of the UTF-8 interfaces is preferred, as SQLite currently
** does all parsing using UTF-8.  The UTF-16 interfaces are provided
** as a convenience.  The UTF-16 interfaces work by converting the
** input text into UTF-8, then invoking the corresponding UTF-8 interface.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare(), sqlite3_prepare_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare_v3()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16(), sqlite3_prepare16_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare16_v3() use UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is negative, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. ^If nByte is positive, then it is the
** number of bytes read from zSql.  ^If nByte is zero, then no prepared
** statement is generated.
** If the caller knows that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then
** there is a small performance advantage to passing an nByte parameter that
** is the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator.
**
** ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** ^*ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  ^If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** ^On success, the sqlite3_prepare() family of routines return [SQLITE_OK];
** otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2(), sqlite3_prepare_v3(), sqlite3_prepare16_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare16_v3() interfaces are recommended for all new programs.
** The older interfaces (sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare16())
** are retained for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** ^In the "vX" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave differently in three ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** ^If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again. As many as [SQLITE_MAX_SCHEMA_RETRY]
** retries will occur before sqlite3_step() gives up and returns an error.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
** [error codes] or [extended error codes].  ^The legacy behavior was that
** [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
** and the application would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()]
** in order to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
** interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^If the specific value bound to a [parameter | host parameter] in the
** WHERE clause might influence the choice of query plan for a statement,
** then the statement will be automatically recompiled, as if there had been
** a schema change, on the first [sqlite3_step()] call following any change
** to the [sqlite3_bind_text | bindings] of that [parameter].
** ^The specific value of a WHERE-clause [parameter] might influence the
** choice of query plan if the parameter is the left-hand side of a [LIKE]
** or [GLOB] operator or if the parameter is compared to an indexed column
** and the [SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4] compile-time option is enabled.
** </li>
** </ol>
**
** <p>^sqlite3_prepare_v3() differs from sqlite3_prepare_v2() only in having
** the extra prepFlags parameter, which is a bit array consisting of zero or
** more of the [SQLITE_PREPARE_PERSISTENT|SQLITE_PREPARE_*] flags.  ^The
** sqlite3_prepare_v2() interface works exactly the same as
** sqlite3_prepare_v3() with a zero prepFlags parameter.
