** CAPI3REF: Application Defined Page Cache.
** KEYWORDS: {page cache}
**
** ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
** register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an
** instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
** In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by
** SQLite is used for the page cache.
** By implementing a
** custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
** the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which
** that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to
** determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for
** how long.
**
** The alternative page cache mechanism is an
** extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
** The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
**
** ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an
** internal buffer by SQLite within the call to [sqlite3_config].  Hence
** the application may discard the parameter after the call to
** [sqlite3_config()] returns.)^
**
** [[the xInit() page cache method]]
** ^(The xInit() method is called once for each effective
** call to [sqlite3_initialize()])^
** (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). ^(The xInit()
** method is passed a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2.pArg value.)^
** The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures
** required by the custom page cache implementation.
** ^(If the xInit() method is NULL, then the
** built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
** page cache.)^
**
** [[the xShutdown() page cache method]]
** ^The xShutdown() method is called by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
** It can be used to clean up
** any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
** ^The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
**
** ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,
** so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  All other methods must be threadsafe
** in multithreaded applications.
**
** ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().
**
** [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
** SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
** though this is not guaranteed. ^The
** first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
** be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The
** second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage
** associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
** a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
** extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
** database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
** on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
** ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
** created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
** false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
** does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
** it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
** never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
** ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
** false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.
** ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
** never contain any unpinned pages.
**
** [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
** ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
** suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
** instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
** the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
** parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
** value; it is advisory only.
**
** [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
** The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
** stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
**
** [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
** The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to
** an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
** The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
** pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a
** single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
** a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
** for each entry in the page cache.
**
** The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
** is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
** to be "pinned".
**
** If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
** implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
** intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
** cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
** parameter to help it determined what action to take:
**
** <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
** <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
** <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
** <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
**                 Otherwise return NULL.
** <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
**                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
** </table>
**
** ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
** will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
** failed.)^  In between the xFetch() calls, SQLite may
** attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
** pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
**
** [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
** ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
** as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
** then the page must be evicted from the cache.
** ^If the discard parameter is
** zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
** page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
** may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
**
** The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single
** call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls
** to xFetch().
**
** [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
** The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
** page passed as the second argument. If the cache
** previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
** discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
** to be pinned.
**
** When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
** existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
** to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
** of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
** they can be safely discarded.
**
** [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
** ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
** All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After
** calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
** handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods2
** functions.
**
** [[the xShrink() page cache method]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xShrink() method when it wants the page cache to
** free up as much of heap memory as possible.  The page cache implementation
** is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should
** do their best.

** ^The source and destination [database connections] (parameters S and D)
** must be different or else sqlite3_backup_init(D,N,S,M) will fail with
** an error.
**
** ^A call to sqlite3_backup_init() will fail, returning NULL, if

** ^The error code and message for the failed call to sqlite3_backup_init()
