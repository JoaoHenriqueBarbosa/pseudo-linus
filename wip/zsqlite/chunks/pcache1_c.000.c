**
** This file implements the default page cache implementation (the
** sqlite3_pcache interface). It also contains part of the implementation
** of the SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE and sqlite3_release_memory() features.
** If the default page cache implementation is overridden, then neither of
** these two features are available.
**
** A Page cache line looks like this:
**
**  -------------------------------------------------------------
**  |  database page content   |  PgHdr1  |  MemPage  |  PgHdr  |
**  -------------------------------------------------------------
**
** The database page content is up front (so that buffer overreads tend to
** flow harmlessly into the PgHdr1, MemPage, and PgHdr extensions).   MemPage
** is the extension added by the btree.c module containing information such
** as the database page number and how that database page is used.  PgHdr
** is added by the pcache.c layer and contains information used to keep track
** of which pages are "dirty".  PgHdr1 is an extension added by this
** module (pcache1.c).  The PgHdr1 header is a subclass of sqlite3_pcache_page.
** PgHdr1 contains information needed to look up a page by its page number.
** The superclass sqlite3_pcache_page.pBuf points to the start of the
** database page content and sqlite3_pcache_page.pExtra points to PgHdr.
**
** The size of the extension (MemPage+PgHdr+PgHdr1) can be determined at
** runtime using sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE_HDRSZ, &size).  The
** sizes of the extensions sum to 272 bytes on x64 for 3.8.10, but this
** size can vary according to architecture, compile-time options, and
** SQLite library version number.
**
** Historical note:  It used to be that if the SQLITE_PCACHE_SEPARATE_HEADER
** was defined, then the page content would be held in a separate memory
** allocation from the PgHdr1.  This was intended to avoid clownshoe memory
** allocations.  However, the btree layer needs a small (16-byte) overrun
** area after the page content buffer.  The header serves as that overrun
** area.  Therefore SQLITE_PCACHE_SEPARATE_HEADER was discontinued to avoid
** any possibility of a memory error.
**
** This module tracks pointers to PgHdr1 objects.  Only pcache.c communicates
** with this module.  Information is passed back and forth as PgHdr1 pointers.
**
** The pcache.c and pager.c modules deal pointers to PgHdr objects.
** The btree.c module deals with pointers to MemPage objects.
**
** SOURCE OF PAGE CACHE MEMORY:
**
** Memory for a page might come from any of three sources:
**
**    (1)  The general-purpose memory allocator - sqlite3Malloc()
**    (2)  Global page-cache memory provided using sqlite3_config() with
**         SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE.
**    (3)  PCache-local bulk allocation.
**
** The third case is a chunk of heap memory (defaulting to 100 pages worth)
** that is allocated when the page cache is created.  The size of the local
** bulk allocation can be adjusted using
**
**     sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE, (void*)0, 0, N).
**
** If N is positive, then N pages worth of memory are allocated using a single
** sqlite3Malloc() call and that memory is used for the first N pages allocated.
** Or if N is negative, then -1024*N bytes of memory are allocated and used
** for as many pages as can be accommodated.
**
** Only one of (2) or (3) can be used.  Once the memory available to (2) or
** (3) is exhausted, subsequent allocations fail over to the general-purpose
** memory allocator (1).
**
** Earlier versions of SQLite used only methods (1) and (2).  But experiments
** show that method (3) with N==100 provides about a 5% performance boost for
** common workloads.

/*
** Each cache entry is represented by an instance of the following
** structure. A buffer of PgHdr1.pCache->szPage bytes is allocated
** directly before this structure and is used to cache the page content.
**
** When reading a corrupt database file, it is possible that SQLite might
** read a few bytes (no more than 16 bytes) past the end of the page buffer.
** It will only read past the end of the page buffer, never write.  This
** object is positioned immediately after the page buffer to serve as an
** overrun area, so that overreads are harmless.
**
** Variables isBulkLocal and isAnchor were once type "u8". That works,
** but causes a 2-byte gap in the structure for most architectures (since
** pointers must be either 4 or 8-byte aligned). As this structure is located
** in memory directly after the associated page data, if the database is
** corrupt, code at the b-tree layer may overread the page buffer and
** read part of this structure before the corruption is detected. This
** can cause a valgrind error if the uninitialized gap is accessed. Using u16
** ensures there is no such gap, and therefore no bytes of uninitialized
** memory in the structure.
**
** The pLruNext and pLruPrev pointers form a double-linked circular list
** of all pages that are unpinned.  The PGroup.lru element (which should be
** the only element on the list with PgHdr1.isAnchor set to 1) forms the
** beginning and the end of the list.

**        one PGroup per PCache.
**
**   (2)  There is a single global PGroup that all PCaches are a member
**        of.
