** underlying native file handle associated with a file handle.  This file
** control interprets its argument as a pointer to a native file handle and
** writes the resulting value there.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to swap the file handle with the one
** pointed to by the pArg argument.  This capability is used during testing
** and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST is defined.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK] is a signal to the VFS layer that it might
** be advantageous to block on the next WAL lock if the lock is not immediately
** available.  The WAL subsystem issues this signal during rare
** circumstances in order to fix a problem with priority inversion.
** Applications should <em>not</em> use this file-control.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS] opcode is implemented by zipvfs only. All other
** VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for this opcode.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU] opcode is implemented by the special VFS used by
** the RBU extension only.  All other VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for
** this opcode.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode returns SQLITE_OK, then
** the file descriptor is placed in "batch write mode", which
** means all subsequent write operations will be deferred and done
** atomically at the next [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE].  Systems
** that do not support batch atomic writes will return SQLITE_NOTFOUND.
** ^Following a successful SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE and prior to
** the closing [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE] or
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE], SQLite will make
** no VFS interface calls on the same [sqlite3_file] file descriptor
** except for calls to the xWrite method and the xFileControl method
** with [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode causes all write
** operations since the previous successful call to
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] to be performed atomically.
** This file control returns [SQLITE_OK] if and only if the writes were
** all performed successfully and have been committed to persistent storage.
** ^Regardless of whether or not it is successful, this file control takes
** the file descriptor out of batch write mode so that all subsequent
** write operations are independent.
** ^SQLite will never invoke SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE without
** a prior successful call to [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode causes all write
** operations since the previous successful call to
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] to be rolled back.
** ^This file control takes the file descriptor out of batch write mode
** so that all subsequent write operations are independent.
** ^SQLite will never invoke SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE without
** a prior successful call to [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCK_TIMEOUT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCK_TIMEOUT] opcode is used to configure a VFS
** to block for up to M milliseconds before failing when attempting to
** obtain a file lock using the xLock or xShmLock methods of the VFS.
** The parameter is a pointer to a 32-bit signed integer that contains
** the value that M is to be set to. Before returning, the 32-bit signed
** integer is overwritten with the previous value of M.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION] opcode is used to detect changes to
** a database file.  The argument is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer.
** The "data version" for the pager is written into the pointer.  The
** "data version" changes whenever any change occurs to the corresponding
** database file, either through SQL statements on the same database
** connection or through transactions committed by separate database
** connections possibly in other processes. The [sqlite3_total_changes()]
** interface can be used to find if any database on the connection has changed,
** but that interface responds to changes on TEMP as well as MAIN and does
** not provide a mechanism to detect changes to MAIN only.  Also, the
** [sqlite3_total_changes()] interface responds to internal changes only and
** omits changes made by other database connections.  The
** [PRAGMA data_version] command provides a mechanism to detect changes to
** a single attached database that occur due to other database connections,
** but omits changes implemented by the database connection on which it is
** called.  This file control is the only mechanism to detect changes that
** happen either internally or externally and that are associated with
** a particular attached database.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_START]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_START] opcode is invoked from within a checkpoint
** in wal mode before the client starts to copy pages from the wal
** file to the database file.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_DONE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_DONE] opcode is invoked from within a checkpoint
** in wal mode after the client has finished copying pages from the wal
** file to the database file, but before the *-shm file is updated to
** record the fact that the pages have been checkpointed.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_EXTERNAL_READER]]
** The EXPERIMENTAL [SQLITE_FCNTL_EXTERNAL_READER] opcode is used to detect
** whether or not there is a database client in another process with a wal-mode
** transaction open on the database or not. It is only available on unix.The
** (void*) argument passed with this file-control should be a pointer to a
** value of type (int). The integer value is set to 1 if the database is a wal
** mode database and there exists at least one client in another process that
** currently has an SQL transaction open on the database. It is set to 0 if
** the database is not a wal-mode db, or if there is no such connection in any
** other process. This opcode cannot be used to detect transactions opened
** by clients within the current process, only within other processes.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKSM_FILE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKSM_FILE] opcode is for use internally by the
** [checksum VFS shim] only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RESET_CACHE]]
** If there is currently no transaction open on the database, and the
** database is not a temp db, then the [SQLITE_FCNTL_RESET_CACHE] file-control
** purges the contents of the in-memory page cache. If there is an open
** transaction, or if the db is a temp-db, this opcode is a no-op, not an error.

typedef const char *sqlite3_filename;

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
**
** An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
** the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
** the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
**
** The VFS interface is sometimes extended by adding new methods onto
** the end.  Each time such an extension occurs, the iVersion field
** is incremented.  The iVersion value started out as 1 in
** SQLite [version 3.5.0] on [dateof:3.5.0], then increased to 2
** with SQLite [version 3.7.0] on [dateof:3.7.0], and then increased
** to 3 with SQLite [version 3.7.6] on [dateof:3.7.6].  Additional fields
** may be appended to the sqlite3_vfs object and the iVersion value
** may increase again in future versions of SQLite.
** Note that due to an oversight, the structure
** of the sqlite3_vfs object changed in the transition from
** SQLite [version 3.5.9] to [version 3.6.0] on [dateof:3.6.0]
** and yet the iVersion field was not increased.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
** implementation should use the pNext pointer.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
** ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
** is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
** from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
** ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
** consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
** 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
** ^SQLite further guarantees that
** the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called. Because of the previous sentence,
** the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
** If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
** must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the
** xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
** flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE].
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
**
** ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUPER_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
** </ul>)^
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
**
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
** databases, and subjournals.
**
** ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
** analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
** API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the
** SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
** be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
** It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened
** for exclusive access.
**
** ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
** to hold the [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
** argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
** the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
** a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
** this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
** element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
** or failure of the xOpen call.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
** ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
** to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
** test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test whether a file is at least readable.  The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
** flag is never actually used and is not implemented in the built-in
** VFSes of SQLite.  The file is named by the second argument and can be a
** directory. The xAccess method returns [SQLITE_OK] on success or some
** non-zero error code if there is an I/O error or if the name of
** the file given in the second argument is illegal.  If SQLITE_OK
** is returned, then non-zero or zero is written into *pResOut to indicate
** whether or not the file is accessible.
**
** ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
** output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
** is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
** interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
** a floating point value.
** ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
** Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in
** a 24-hour day).
** ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
** date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or
** greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
** to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
**
** ^The xSetSystemCall(), xGetSystemCall(), and xNestSystemCall() interfaces
** are not used by the SQLite core.  These optional interfaces are provided
** by some VFSes to facilitate testing of the VFS code. By overriding
** system calls with functions under its control, a test program can
** simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult
** or impossible to induce.  The set of system calls that can be overridden
** varies from one VFS to another, and from one version of the same VFS to the
** next.  Applications that use these interfaces must be prepared for any
** or all of these interfaces to be NULL or for their behavior to change
** from one release to the next.  Applications must not attempt to access
** any of these methods if the iVersion of the VFS is less than 3.
