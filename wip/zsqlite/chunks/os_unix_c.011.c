** When multiple threads all reference the same wal-index, each thread
** has its own unixShm object, but they all point to a single instance
** of this unixShmNode object.  In other words, each wal-index is opened
** only once per process.
**
** Each unixShmNode object is connected to a single unixInodeInfo object.
** We could coalesce this object into unixInodeInfo, but that would mean
** every open file that does not use shared memory (in other words, most
** open files) would have to carry around this extra information.  So
** the unixInodeInfo object contains a pointer to this unixShmNode object
** and the unixShmNode object is created only when needed.
**
** unixMutexHeld() must be true when creating or destroying
** this object or while reading or writing the following fields:
**
**      nRef
**
** The following fields are read-only after the object is created:
**
**      hShm
**      zFilename
**
** Either unixShmNode.pShmMutex must be held or unixShmNode.nRef==0 and
** unixMutexHeld() is true when reading or writing any other field
** in this structure.
**
** aLock[SQLITE_SHM_NLOCK]:
**   This array records the various locks held by clients on each of the
**   SQLITE_SHM_NLOCK slots. If the aLock[] entry is set to 0, then no
**   locks are held by the process on this slot. If it is set to -1, then
**   some client holds an EXCLUSIVE lock on the locking slot. If the aLock[]
**   value is set to a positive value, then it is the number of shared
**   locks currently held on the slot.
**
** aMutex[SQLITE_SHM_NLOCK]:
**   Normally, when SQLITE_ENABLE_SETLK_TIMEOUT is not defined, mutex
**   pShmMutex is used to protect the aLock[] array and the right to
**   call fcntl() on unixShmNode.hShm to obtain or release locks.
**
**   If SQLITE_ENABLE_SETLK_TIMEOUT is defined though, we use an array
**   of mutexes - one for each locking slot. To read or write locking
**   slot aLock[iSlot], the caller must hold the corresponding mutex
**   aMutex[iSlot]. Similarly, to call fcntl() to obtain or release a
**   lock corresponding to slot iSlot, mutex aMutex[iSlot] must be held.
