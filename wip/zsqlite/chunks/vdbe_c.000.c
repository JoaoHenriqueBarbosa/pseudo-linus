** M is the type of branch.  I is the direction taken for this instance of

**

**      4 - OP_Jump        (I=0: jump p1     1: jump p2   2: jump p3)
**
** In other words, if M is 2, then I is either 0 (for fall-through) or
** 1 (for when the branch is taken).  If M is 3, the I is 0 for an
** ordinary fall-through, I is 1 if the branch was taken, and I is 2
** if the result of comparison is NULL.  For M=3, I=2 the jump may or
** may not be taken, depending on the SQLITE_JUMPIFNULL flags in p5.
** When M is 4, that means that an OP_Jump is being run.  I is 0, 1, or 2
** depending on if the operands are less than, equal, or greater than.
**
** iSrcLine is the source code line (from the __LINE__ macro) that
** generated the VDBE instruction combined with flag bits.  The source
** code line number is in the lower 24 bits of iSrcLine and the upper
** 8 bytes are flags.  The lower three bits of the flags indicate
** values for I that should never occur.  For example, if the branch is
** always taken, the flags should be 0x05 since the fall-through and
** alternate branch are never taken.  If a branch is never taken then
** flags should be 0x06 since only the fall-through approach is allowed.
**
** Bit 0x08 of the flags indicates an OP_Jump opcode that is only
** interested in equal or not-equal.  In other words, I==0 and I==2
** should be treated as equivalent
**
** Since only a line number is retained, not the filename, this macro
** only works for amalgamation builds.  But that is ok, since these macros
** should be no-ops except for special builds used to measure test coverage.
