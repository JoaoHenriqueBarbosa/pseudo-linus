** unchanged since the file size is part of the inode.  However,
** Ted Ts'o tells us that fdatasync() will also write the inode if the
** file size has changed.  The only real difference between fdatasync()
** and fsync(), Ted tells us, is that fdatasync() will not flush the
** inode if the mtime or owner or other inode attributes have changed.
** We only care about the file size, not the other file attributes, so
** as far as SQLite is concerned, an fdatasync() is always adequate.
