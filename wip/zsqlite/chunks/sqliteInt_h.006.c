** SQLite supports many different ways to resolve a constraint
** error.  ROLLBACK processing means that a constraint violation

** fails and any prior changes from that one operation are backed out,
** but the transaction is not rolled back.  FAIL processing means that
** the operation in progress stops and returns an error code.  But prior
** changes due to the same operation are not backed out and no rollback
** occurs.  IGNORE means that the particular row that caused the constraint
** error is not inserted or updated.  Processing continues and no error
** is returned.  REPLACE means that preexisting database rows that caused
** a UNIQUE constraint violation are removed so that the new insert or
** update can proceed.  Processing continues and no error is reported.
** UPDATE applies to insert operations only and means that the insert
** is omitted and the DO UPDATE clause of an upsert is run instead.
**
** RESTRICT, SETNULL, SETDFLT, and CASCADE actions apply only to foreign keys.
** RESTRICT is the same as ABORT for IMMEDIATE foreign keys and the
** same as ROLLBACK for DEFERRED keys.  SETNULL means that the foreign
** key is set to NULL.  SETDFLT means that the foreign key is set
** to its default value.  CASCADE means that a DELETE or UPDATE of the
** referenced table row is propagated into the row that holds the
** foreign key.
**

** This object holds a record which has been parsed out into individual
** fields, for the purposes of doing a comparison.
**
** A record is an object that contains one or more fields of data.
** Records are used to store the content of a table row and to store
** the key of an index.  A blob encoding of a record is created by
** the OP_MakeRecord opcode of the VDBE and is disassembled by the
** OP_Column opcode.
**
** An instance of this object serves as a "key" for doing a search on
** an index b+tree. The goal of the search is to find the entry that
** is closed to the key described by this object.  This object might hold
** just a prefix of the key.  The number of fields is given by
** pKeyInfo->nField.
**
** The r1 and r2 fields are the values to return if this key is less than
** or greater than a key in the btree, respectively.  These are normally
** -1 and +1 respectively, but might be inverted to +1 and -1 if the b-tree
** is in DESC order.
**
** The key comparison functions actually return default_rc when they find
** an equals comparison.  default_rc can be -1, 0, or +1.  If there are
** multiple entries in the b-tree with the same key (when only looking
** at the first pKeyInfo->nFields,) then default_rc can be set to -1 to
** cause the search to find the last match, or +1 to cause the search to
** find the first match.
**
** The key comparison functions will set eqSeen to true if they ever
** get and equal results when comparing this structure to a b-tree record.
** When default_rc!=0, the search might end up on the record immediately
** before the first match or immediately after the last match.  The
** eqSeen field will indicate whether or not an exact match exists in the
** b-tree.

** Each SQL index is represented in memory by an
** instance of the following structure.
**
** The columns of the table that are to be indexed are described
** by the aiColumn[] field of this structure.  For example, suppose
** we have the following table and index:
**
**     CREATE TABLE Ex1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 text);
**     CREATE INDEX Ex2 ON Ex1(c3,c1);
**
** In the Table structure describing Ex1, nCol==3 because there are
** three columns in the table.  In the Index structure describing
** Ex2, nColumn==2 since 2 of the 3 columns of Ex1 are indexed.
** The value of aiColumn is {2, 0}.  aiColumn[0]==2 because the
** first column to be indexed (c3) has an index of 2 in Ex1.aCol[].
** The second column to be indexed (c1) has an index of 0 in
** Ex1.aCol[], hence Ex2.aiColumn[1]==0.
**
** The Index.onError field determines whether or not the indexed columns
** must be unique and what to do if they are not.  When Index.onError=OE_None,
** it means this is not a unique index.  Otherwise it is a unique index
** and the value of Index.onError indicates which conflict resolution
** algorithm to employ when an attempt is made to insert a non-unique
** element.
**
** The colNotIdxed bitmask is used in combination with SrcItem.colUsed
** for a fast test to see if an index can serve as a covering index.
** colNotIdxed has a 1 bit for every column of the original table that
** is *not* available in the index.  Thus the expression
** "colUsed & colNotIdxed" will be non-zero if the index is not a
** covering index.  The most significant bit of of colNotIdxed will always
** be true (note-20221022-a).  If a column beyond the 63rd column of the
** table is used, the "colUsed & colNotIdxed" test will always be non-zero
** and we have to assume either that the index is not covering, or use
** an alternative (slower) algorithm to determine whether or not
** the index is covering.
**
** While parsing a CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement in order to
** generate VDBE code (as opposed to parsing one read from an sqlite_schema
** table as part of parsing an existing database schema), transient instances
** of this structure may be created. In this case the Index.tnum variable is
** used to store the address of a VDBE instruction, not a database page
** number (it cannot - the database page is not allocated until the VDBE
** program is executed). See convertToWithoutRowidTable() for details.
