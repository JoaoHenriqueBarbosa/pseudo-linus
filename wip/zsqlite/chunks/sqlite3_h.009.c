** handler is disabled.
**
** ^Only a single progress handler may be defined at one time per

** ^The progress handler is also disabled by setting N to a value less

** ^If the progress callback returns non-zero, the operation is

** CAPI3REF: Opening A New Database Connection
** CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3

** filename argument. ^The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8 for
** sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open_v2() and as UTF-16 in the native byte
** order for sqlite3_open16(). ^(A [database connection] handle is usually
** returned in *ppDb, even if an error occurs.  The only exception is that
** if SQLite is unable to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3] object,
** a NULL will be written into *ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3]
** object.)^ ^(If the database is opened (and/or created) successfully, then
** [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an [error code] is returned.)^ ^The
** [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()] routines can be used to obtain
** an English language description of the error following a failure of any
** of the sqlite3_open() routines.
**
** ^The default encoding will be UTF-8 for databases created using
** sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_open_v2().  ^The default encoding for databases
** created using sqlite3_open16() will be UTF-16 in the native byte order.
**
** Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
** associated with the [database connection] handle should be released by
** passing it to [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
**
** The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open()
** except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control
** over the new database connection.  ^(The flags parameter to

** three flag combinations:)^

** not already exist, an error is returned.</dd>)^

** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing if possible, or
** reading only if the file is write protected by the operating
** system.  In either case the database must already exist, otherwise
** an error is returned.  For historical reasons, if opening in
** read-write mode fails due to OS-level permissions, an attempt is
** made to open it in read-only mode. [sqlite3_db_readonly()] can be
** used to determine whether the database is actually
** read-write.</dd>)^
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing, and is created if
** it does not already exist. This is the behavior that is always used for
** sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open16().</dd>)^
** </dl>
**
** In addition to the required flags, the following optional flags are
** also supported:
**
** <dl>
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_URI]</dt>
** <dd>The filename can be interpreted as a URI if this flag is set.</dd>)^
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_MEMORY]</dt>

** is named by the "filename" argument for the purposes of cache-sharing,
** if shared cache mode is enabled, but the "filename" is otherwise ignored.
** </dd>)^
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX]</dt>
** <dd>The new database connection will use the "multi-thread"
** [threading mode].)^  This means that separate threads are allowed
** to use SQLite at the same time, as long as each thread is using
** a different [database connection].
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX]</dt>
** <dd>The new database connection will use the "serialized"
** [threading mode].)^  This means the multiple threads can safely
** attempt to use the same database connection at the same time.
** (Mutexes will block any actual concurrency, but in this mode
** there is no harm in trying.)
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened [shared cache] enabled, overriding
** the default shared cache setting provided by
** [sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()].)^
** The [use of shared cache mode is discouraged] and hence shared cache
** capabilities may be omitted from many builds of SQLite.  In such cases,
** this option is a no-op.
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened [shared cache] disabled, overriding
** the default shared cache setting provided by
** [sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()].)^
**
** [[OPEN_EXRESCODE]] ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_EXRESCODE]</dt>
** <dd>The database connection comes up in "extended result code mode".
** In other words, the database behaves has if
** [sqlite3_extended_result_codes(db,1)] where called on the database
** connection as soon as the connection is created. In addition to setting

**
** If the 3rd parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is not one of the

** [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY | SQLITE_OPEN_* bits]
** then the behavior is undefined.  Historic versions of SQLite
** have silently ignored surplus bits in the flags parameter to
** sqlite3_open_v2(), however that behavior might not be carried through
** into future versions of SQLite and so applications should not rely
** upon it.  Note in particular that the SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag is a no-op
** for sqlite3_open_v2().  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE does *not* cause
** the open to fail if the database already exists.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE
** flag is intended for use by the [sqlite3_vfs|VFS interface] only, and not
** by sqlite3_open_v2().
**
** ^The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system interface that
** the new database connection should use.  ^If the fourth parameter is
** a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs] object is used.
**
** ^If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
** is created for the connection.  ^This in-memory database will vanish when
** the database connection is closed.  Future versions of SQLite might
** make use of additional special filenames that begin with the ":" character.
