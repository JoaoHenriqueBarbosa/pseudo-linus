** is another alias for the rowid.
**
** ^The sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) interface usually returns the [rowid] of
** the most recent successful [INSERT] into a rowid table or [virtual table]
** on database connection D. ^Inserts into [WITHOUT ROWID] tables are not
** recorded. ^If no successful [INSERT]s into rowid tables have ever occurred
** on the database connection D, then sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) returns
** zero.
**
** As well as being set automatically as rows are inserted into database
** tables, the value returned by this function may be set explicitly by
** [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()]
**
** Some virtual table implementations may INSERT rows into rowid tables as
** part of committing a transaction (e.g. to flush data accumulated in memory
** to disk). In this case subsequent calls to this function return the rowid
** associated with these internal INSERT operations, which leads to
** unintuitive results. Virtual table implementations that do write to rowid
** tables in this way can avoid this problem by restoring the original
** rowid value using [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()] before returning
** control to the user.
**
** ^(If an [INSERT] occurs within a trigger then this routine will
** return the [rowid] of the inserted row as long as the trigger is
** running. Once the trigger program ends, the value returned
** by this routine reverts to what it was before the trigger was fired.)^
**
** ^An [INSERT] that fails due to a constraint violation is not a
** successful [INSERT] and does not change the value returned by this
** routine.  ^Thus INSERT OR FAIL, INSERT OR IGNORE, INSERT OR ROLLBACK,
** and INSERT OR ABORT make no changes to the return value of this
** routine when their insertion fails.  ^(When INSERT OR REPLACE
** encounters a constraint violation, it does not fail.  The
** INSERT continues to completion after deleting rows that caused
** the constraint problem so INSERT OR REPLACE will always change
** the return value of this interface.)^
**
** ^For the purposes of this routine, an [INSERT] is considered to
** be successful even if it is subsequently rolled back.
**
** This function is accessible to SQL statements via the
** [last_insert_rowid() SQL function].
**
** If a separate thread performs a new [INSERT] on the same
** database connection while the [sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()]
** function is running and thus changes the last insert [rowid],
** then the value returned by [sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()] is

** The two functions are identical except for the type of the return value
** and that if the number of rows modified by the most recent INSERT, UPDATE
** or DELETE is greater than the maximum value supported by type "int", then
** the return value of sqlite3_changes() is undefined. ^Executing any other
** type of SQL statement does not modify the value returned by these functions.
**
** ^Only changes made directly by the INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement are
** considered - auxiliary changes caused by [CREATE TRIGGER | triggers],
** [foreign key actions] or [REPLACE] constraint resolution are not counted.
**
** Changes to a view that are intercepted by
** [INSTEAD OF trigger | INSTEAD OF triggers] are not counted. ^The value
** returned by sqlite3_changes() immediately after an INSERT, UPDATE or
** DELETE statement run on a view is always zero. Only changes made to real
** tables are counted.
**
** Things are more complicated if the sqlite3_changes() function is
** executed while a trigger program is running. This may happen if the
** program uses the [changes() SQL function], or if some other callback
** function invokes sqlite3_changes() directly. Essentially:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> ^(Before entering a trigger program the value returned by

**        any changes performed by sub-triggers, as the sqlite3_changes()
**        value will be saved and restored after each sub-trigger has run.)^
** </ul>
**
** ^This means that if the changes() SQL function (or similar) is used
** by the first INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement within a trigger, it

** ^If it is used by the second or subsequent such statement within a trigger
** program, the value returned reflects the number of rows modified by the

** CAPI3REF: Register A Callback To Handle SQLITE_BUSY Errors
** KEYWORDS: {busy-handler callback} {busy handler}

** ^The sqlite3_busy_handler(D,X,P) routine sets a callback function X
** that might be invoked with argument P whenever
** an attempt is made to access a database table associated with
** [database connection] D when another thread
** or process has the table locked.
** The sqlite3_busy_handler() interface is used to implement
** [sqlite3_busy_timeout()] and [PRAGMA busy_timeout].
**
** ^If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY]
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock.  ^If the busy callback
** is not NULL, then the callback might be invoked with two arguments.
**
** ^The first argument to the busy handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to sqlite3_busy_handler().  ^The second argument to
** the busy handler callback is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked previously for the same locking event.  ^If the
** busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] is returned
** to the application.
** ^If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
** is made to access the database and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that it will be invoked
** when there is lock contention. ^If SQLite determines that invoking the busy
** handler could result in a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY]
** to the application instead of invoking the
** busy handler.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
** proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
** invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
** SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** ^The default busy callback is NULL.

** ^(There can only be a single busy handler defined for each

** previously set handler.)^  ^Note that calling [sqlite3_busy_timeout()]
** or evaluating [PRAGMA busy_timeout=N] will change the
** busy handler and thus clear any previously set busy handler.

** The busy callback should not take any actions which modify the

** the busy handler is not reentrant.  Any such actions
** result in undefined behavior.

**
** This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility.

**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
