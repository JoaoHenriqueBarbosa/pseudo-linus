** This routine generates VDBE code that causes a single row of a
** single table to be deleted.  Both the original table entry and
** all indices are removed.
**
** Preconditions:
**
**   1.  iDataCur is an open cursor on the btree that is the canonical data
**       store for the table.  (This will be either the table itself,
**       in the case of a rowid table, or the PRIMARY KEY index in the case
**       of a WITHOUT ROWID table.)
**
**   2.  Read/write cursors for all indices of pTab must be open as
**       cursor number iIdxCur+i for the i-th index.
**
**   3.  The primary key for the row to be deleted must be stored in a
**       sequence of nPk memory cells starting at iPk.  If nPk==0 that means
**       that a search record formed from OP_MakeRecord is contained in the
**       single memory location iPk.
**
** eMode:
**   Parameter eMode may be passed either ONEPASS_OFF (0), ONEPASS_SINGLE, or
**   ONEPASS_MULTI.  If eMode is not ONEPASS_OFF, then the cursor
**   iDataCur already points to the row to delete. If eMode is ONEPASS_OFF
**   then this function must seek iDataCur to the entry identified by iPk
**   and nPk before reading from it.
**
**   If eMode is ONEPASS_MULTI, then this call is being made as part
**   of a ONEPASS delete that affects multiple rows. In this case, if
**   iIdxNoSeek is a valid cursor number (>=0) and is not the same as
**   iDataCur, then its position should be preserved following the delete
**   operation. Or, if iIdxNoSeek is not a valid cursor number, the
**   position of iDataCur should be preserved instead.
**
** iIdxNoSeek:
**   If iIdxNoSeek is a valid cursor number (>=0) not equal to iDataCur,
**   then it identifies an index cursor (from within array of cursors
**   starting at iIdxCur) that already points to the index entry to be deleted.
**   Except, this optimization is disabled if there are BEFORE triggers since
**   the trigger body might have moved the cursor.
